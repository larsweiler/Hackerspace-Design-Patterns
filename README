LaTeX Beamer Sources for the Hackerspace Design Patterns

This is the presentation shown at the 24th Chaos Communication Congress: “Volldampf voraus!” on December 27th 2007 in Berlin. http://events.ccc.de/congress/2007/Fahrplan/events/2133.en.html

The first presentation was shown during the “Hackers on a Plane” tour in August 2007.  Since then some patterns were modified or extended.  Have a look at https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/Design_Patterns for more inspiration.
